            The Possible Aliases pane shows all of the possible aliases for the selected user based on the MIT rankings which uses a custom algorithm to
            determine what aliases this user may be using. The bars represent the MIT score.

        <h4>Hashtags</h4>
        <p>
            The Hashtags pane shows the top 20 hashtags the selected user uses in their posts. The bars represent the quantity
            the user has used the hashtag in their posts.
